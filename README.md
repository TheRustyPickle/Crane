Crane is a simple GUI application built with [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) for managing binaries installed with cargo install. It lets you check for updates, reinstall, or remove installed crates through a minimal interface inspired by [pamac-manager](https://github.com/manjaro/pamac).

## Features

* View all installed Cargo binaries
* Lock a crate to prevent updates
* Enable or disable default and optional features
* Install or update crates directly from a git source (--git flag)
* Remove installed crates
* View real-time installation logs

## Motivation

I use a number of tools installed through cargo install (like `diesel_cli`, `cargo-nextest`, `cargo-binstall`, and `trunk`) and thereâ€™s no simple way to see when updates are available. Crane provides a small, focused interface for that.

## Installation

The app is not available on crates.io right now. Binary release is coming soon.

```
git clone https://github.com/TheRustyPickle/Crane
cd Crane
cargo run --release
```

## License

Crane is under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
